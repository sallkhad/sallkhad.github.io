  bio: "I am a Molecular and Cellular Biology PhD candidate at Oregon State University. My research focuses on the mechanisms of Abscisic Acid (ABA) metabolism and signal transduction in Arabidopsis thaliana seeds. Previously, Iâ€™ve worked on the oxidative stress in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and on germination/dormancy regulation during oxidative stress in Arabidopsis thaliana. In addition to my research, I have been teaching since my freshman year of college. I taught science to various audiences ranging from children, youth to adults. Currently, I am teaching molecular biology techniques to lab trainees. I am also the founder of an organization that promotes STEM education in Senegal. I am interested in becoming a researcher and educator in the biotechnology fields."
